        and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality.
        The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks,
        which developers can use to integrate many of Steams functions into their products, including networking,
        matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop.
